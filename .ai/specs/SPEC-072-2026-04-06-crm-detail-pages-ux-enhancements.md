# SPEC-072: CRM Detail Pages UX Enhancements

**Created:** 2026-04-06
**Module:** `customers`, `sales`
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Oliwia Zielińska (UX), Maciej (dev)
**Related:** SPEC-046 (Customer Detail v2), SPEC-047 (Sales Document Detail v2), SPEC-041 (UMES), SPEC-046b (Interactions Unification)

---

## TLDR

**Key Points:**

- UX layer on top of implemented SPEC-046 (company/person cards) and draft SPEC-047 (quote/order cards)
- Collapsible CrudForm groups with persistent user preference (localStorage → API)
- Collapsible Zone 1 panel — entire left section (CrudForm) can collapse to a strip, giving Zone 2 full width (inspired by Tilio)
- Inline activity composer (call/email/meeting/note) replacing tab-only access in Zone 2
- Multi-role assignment section on company/person cards (replaces single "responsible person")
- Deal stage progress bar with click-to-advance on sales document cards
- Deal closure flow with won/lost outcome + loss reason dictionary
- Activity timeline filtering and planned-activities pinning in Zone 2
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all new components

**Scope:**

- Modified: company-v2, person-v2 detail pages (SPEC-046 Zone 1 + Zone 2)
- Modified: sales document-v2 detail page (SPEC-047 Zone 1 + Zone 2)
- New components: `CollapsibleGroup`, `CollapsibleZoneLayout`, `InlineActivityComposer`, `RolesSection`, `StageProgressBar`, `DealClosureDialog`, `ActivityTimelineFilters`
- New API endpoints: roles CRUD, activity filtering
- New UMES injection spots for roles and stage bar

**Concerns:**

- Collapsible groups must not break CrudForm validation (collapsed fields must still validate on submit)
- Inline activity composer saves independently from CrudForm (same pattern as tags in SPEC-046)
- Stage progress bar requires pipeline stage definitions from SPEC-028 (Multiple CRM Pipelines)

---

## Scope Classification

This spec contains two categories of changes:

### UX-only enhancements
- Collapsible CrudForm groups
- Collapsible Zone 1 panel
- Inline activity composer
- Activity timeline filtering UI

These changes primarily affect presentation, interaction flow, and client-side behavior. No new database entities, no API contract changes, no migrations.

### Product/domain enhancements
- Multi-role assignment (new entity, migration, API, ACL)
- Deal stage progress bar with closure flow (new columns on sales_documents, extended PATCH payload)

These changes introduce or extend business data, permissions, API contracts, and persistence. They should be estimated and reviewed accordingly, even if shipped under the same UX initiative.

---

## Workstream Dependencies

- **SPEC-046** (implemented): Provides the CrudForm two-zone layout, contentHeader, Zone 2 tabs, and UMES injection spots for company/person pages. This spec extends those pages without modifying the core CrudForm contract.
- **SPEC-047** (draft): Provides the same pattern for sales documents. Stage progress bar and deal closure extend the document contentHeader and add new component groups.
- **SPEC-046b** (implemented): Defines canonical customer interactions (activities/todos). Inline activity composer and timeline filtering consume this data model.
- **SPEC-028** (implemented): Multiple CRM Pipelines — provides pipeline stage definitions consumed by the stage progress bar.

---

## Overview

SPEC-046 and SPEC-047 established the technical foundation for detail pages: CrudForm with whole-document save, UMES injection slots, and Zone 2 related data tabs. However, user testing and competitive analysis (Bitrix24, Pipe Drive, Tilio, Odoo) revealed critical UX gaps:

1. **Information overload** — all CrudForm groups render expanded simultaneously. Users with many custom fields see a wall of data with no way to focus.
2. **Activity creation friction** — adding a call/email/meeting note requires navigating to Zone 2 Activities tab, which is below the fold. CRM power users need < 2 clicks to log an activity.
3. **Single responsible person** — real CRM workflows have multiple roles per entity (sales owner, service owner, account manager). Current model supports only one.
4. **No visual deal progression** — sales document status is a dropdown. Users cannot see where a deal sits in the pipeline at a glance or advance it with one click.
5. **Unfiltered activity history** — Zone 2 Activities tab shows all interactions chronologically with no filtering by type or date range. Users with 100+ activities per entity cannot find relevant history.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State (post SPEC-046/047)

1. **CrudForm groups are static** — groups render as open cards with no collapse/expand toggle. On entities with many custom fields, the form exceeds 3 screen heights.
2. **Activities tab is below the fold** — Zone 2 tabs sit below the CrudForm. Users must scroll past all form groups to reach the activity creation UI. This is the #1 workflow blocker reported in user feedback.
3. **One `assignedTo` field** — company and person entities have a single owner field. In practice, a company has a sales owner, service owner, and potentially project owner — each needing visibility on the card.
4. **Sales document status is a flat select** — no visual pipeline representation. Users cannot see previous/next stages, cannot click to advance, and have no closure flow with outcome tracking.
5. **Activities tab has no filters** — all activity types (call, email, meeting, note, system events) render in one chronological list. No way to filter by type, date range, or show only planned/overdue items.

### Goal

Layer UX enhancements onto the existing SPEC-046/047 architecture without breaking:
- CrudForm whole-document save semantics
- UMES injection slot contracts
- Zone 1 / Zone 2 separation
- API backward compatibility

This spec does not redefine:
- CrudForm save ownership or payload structure
- Canonical interaction model from SPEC-046b
- Pipeline definition ownership from SPEC-028
- Global permission model outside explicitly listed additions (roles ACL)

Each enhancement is independently deployable as a phase.

---

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this spec:
- Redesign of CrudForm core save contract or payload builder
- Replacing the canonical interaction model (SPEC-046b)
- Pipeline configuration authoring (creating/editing pipelines and stages)
- Reporting changes for role ownership or deal closure analytics
- Workflow automations triggered by deal closure (e.g. auto-create project on won)
- Mobile redesign beyond preserving usable stacked layout
- Cross-device persistence of collapse/filter preferences (v1 = localStorage only)
- Onboarding flow or guided tours for new CRM users

---

## Proposed Solution

### Enhancement 1: Collapsible CrudForm Groups

#### Architecture

Wrap each CrudForm group in a `<CollapsibleGroup>` component that adds a chevron toggle to the group header.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▼ Details                       [▲] │  ← click toggles collapse
│   displayName: [Acme Corp        ] │
│   primaryEmail: [info@acme.com   ] │
│   primaryPhone: [+48 500 123 456 ] │
│   status: [Active ▾]               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ► Profile                       [▼] │  ← collapsed, shows only header
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ► Custom Fields                 [▼] │  ← collapsed
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Behavior

| Rule | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| Default state | All groups expanded on first visit. After user collapses, preference is saved. |
| Persistence | `localStorage` key: `om:collapsible:{pageType}:{groupId}` → `boolean`. Future: migrate to user preferences API. |
| Validation | Collapsed groups with validation errors auto-expand on submit attempt. Error badge shows on collapsed header: `► Profile (2 errors)`. |
| Animation | Expand/collapse: 200ms ease-out. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| CrudForm contract | No change to CrudForm internals. `CollapsibleGroup` wraps the group's rendered output. Hidden fields remain in DOM (not unmounted) so form state is preserved. Collapsed groups must participate in validation exactly as expanded groups. Collapse state is purely presentational and must not alter form registration, dirty state, or submit payload. |

#### Component

```tsx
interface CollapsibleGroupProps {
  groupId: string;
  title: string;
  pageType: string; // e.g. 'company', 'person', 'order'
  defaultExpanded?: boolean;
  errorCount?: number;
  children: ReactNode;
}
```

#### Files

| File | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| `packages/core/src/components/CrudForm/CollapsibleGroup.tsx` | New — wraps group content |
| `packages/core/src/components/CrudForm/useGroupCollapse.ts` | New — hook for collapse state + localStorage persistence |
| `packages/core/src/components/CrudForm/CrudFormGroups.tsx` | Modified — wrap each group renderer with `<CollapsibleGroup>` |

---

### Enhancement 1b: Collapsible Zone 1 Panel (inspired by Tilio)

#### Architecture

Entire Zone 1 (CrudForm) can be collapsed to a narrow strip, giving Zone 2 (tabs/history) full page width. Inspired by Tilio's left-panel collapse arrow.

```
EXPANDED (default):                          COLLAPSED:
┌──────────────────┬───────────────────┐    ┌──┬────────────────────────────────┐
│ Zone 1 (40%)     │ Zone 2 (60%)      │    │◄ │ Zone 2 (100% width)            │
│                  │                    │    │  │                                │
│ [Szczegóły]      │ [Notatki|Aktyw..] │ →  │  │ [Notatki|Aktywności|Deale...]  │
│ displayName      │                   │    │  │                                │
│ email            │ timeline...       │    │  │ timeline with full width...    │
│ phone            │                   │    │  │                                │
│ ...              │                   │    │  │                                │
│            [►]   │                   │    │  │                                │
└──────────────────┴───────────────────┘    └──┴────────────────────────────────┘
                                              ↑
                                         click [►] to expand back
```

#### Behavior

| Rule | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| Toggle | Arrow button `[◄]` at the right edge of Zone 1. Click → Zone 1 collapses to ~48px strip showing only the arrow `[►]`. |
| Collapsed strip | Shows entity name vertically rotated (or truncated horizontal) + expand arrow. Enough to identify which entity you're on. |
| Zone 2 expansion | When Zone 1 collapsed, Zone 2 takes `flex: 1` full width. Activity timeline, notes, tables get more horizontal space — especially useful for wide data tables (deals, activities). |
| Use case | CRM power users who opened the card, already know the data, and want to focus on working the account — logging activities, reviewing history, managing deals. They don't need to see 15 form fields while doing that. |
| Persistence | `localStorage` key: `om:zone1-collapsed:{pageType}` → `boolean`. |
| Animation | Slide transition 250ms ease-out. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| Mobile | Not applicable — on mobile (<768px) layout is already stacked vertically, no side-by-side zones. |

#### Focus and validation when collapsed

- If keyboard focus is currently inside Zone 1 and the user collapses it, focus moves to the Zone 1 expand button.
- If CrudForm validation errors exist in Zone 1 while collapsed, the collapsed strip shows an error badge with count (e.g. "2 errors").
- Submitting with Zone 1 collapsed auto-expands it if the first blocking error is inside Zone 1.
- Collapsing Zone 1 never suppresses validation visibility.

#### Component

```tsx
interface CollapsibleZoneLayoutProps {
  zone1: ReactNode;
  zone2: ReactNode;
  entityName: string;          // shown in collapsed strip
  pageType: string;            // for localStorage key
  zone1DefaultWidth?: string;  // default: '40%'
}
```

#### Files

| File | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| `packages/core/src/components/CrudForm/CollapsibleZoneLayout.tsx` | New — wrapper that manages Zone 1 expand/collapse |
| `packages/core/src/components/CrudForm/useZoneCollapse.ts` | New — hook for zone collapse state + persistence |
| Company v2 page, Person v2 page | Modified — wrap existing Zone 1 + Zone 2 in `<CollapsibleZoneLayout>` |
| Sales document v2 page | Modified — same wrapper |

---

### Enhancement 2: Inline Activity Composer

#### Architecture

A compact activity creation widget injected into the **Zone 2 header area** (above tabs, below CrudForm Zone 1). Uses UMES injection spot `detail:customers.company:tabs` rendered as a sticky bar above the tab content.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Zone 1: CrudForm (company fields)                        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ INLINE ACTIVITY COMPOSER (sticky)                        │
│                                                          │
│  [📞 Call] [✉️ Email] [🤝 Meeting] [📝 Note]              │
│                                                          │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ What happened? [________________________] 📅 Today │  │
│  │                                    [Save activity] │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Zone 2: [Notes] [Activities] [Deals] [People] [Tasks]    │
│ ...                                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Behavior

| Rule | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| Trigger | Click one of 4 type icons. Composer expands inline (no modal/popup). |
| Fields | Type (pre-selected by icon), description (text), date (defaults to now), scheduled date (optional, for future activities). |
| Save | Independent from CrudForm — calls `POST /api/customers/interactions` (SPEC-046b contract). Does NOT dirty the CrudForm. |
| After save | Activity appears in Zone 2 Activities tab. Toast confirmation: "Aktywność zapisana" (action-specific, not generic "Saved"). Composer collapses back to icon row. |
| Scope | Bound to current entity: `{ entityType: 'company' | 'person', entityId: string }`. |

#### Form ownership

The InlineActivityComposer is **not** a CrudForm subsection. It is an independent action surface colocated on the detail page.

Implications:
- It maintains its own validation state (description required, date required).
- It has its own save lifecycle (`POST /api/customers/interactions`).
- It does not participate in CrudForm dirty tracking.
- It must not block CrudForm save.
- CrudForm validation must not block activity creation.
- After save, the page should use optimistic prepend into the local activity timeline if the interaction response payload is sufficient. Fallback: refetch Activities tab data. Full page reload is never acceptable.

#### Activity Types (fixed set, per meeting decision)

| Type | Icon | API value |
| ---- | ---- | --------- |
| Call | 📞 | `call` |
| Email | ✉️ | `email` |
| Meeting | 🤝 | `meeting` |
| Note | 📝 | `note` |

#### Component

```tsx
interface InlineActivityComposerProps {
  entityType: 'company' | 'person' | 'deal';
  entityId: string;
  onActivityCreated?: () => void; // refresh Zone 2 Activities tab
}
```

#### API

Uses existing SPEC-046b interactions endpoint:

```
POST /api/customers/interactions
{
  "entityType": "company",
  "entityId": "uuid",
  "type": "call",           // call | email | meeting | note
  "description": "Discussed Q2 contract renewal",
  "occurredAt": "2026-04-06T14:30:00Z",
  "scheduledAt": null        // null = already happened, date = planned
}
```

#### Files

| File | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| `packages/core/src/modules/customers/components/detail/InlineActivityComposer.tsx` | New |
| `packages/core/src/modules/customers/components/detail/ActivityTypeSelector.tsx` | New — icon row component |
| Company v2 page, Person v2 page | Modified — render composer between Zone 1 and Zone 2 |
| Sales document v2 page | Modified — same composer for deal context |

---

### Enhancement 3: Multi-Role Assignment Section

#### Architecture

New CrudForm component group "roles" in Zone 1 (column 1, below "details" group) on company and person cards.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▼ Roles                            │
│                                     │
│  Sales Owner:    [Jan Kowalski  ✕]  │
│  Service Owner:  [— assign —    ▾]  │
│  Account Mgr:    [Anna Nowak    ✕]  │
│                                     │
│  [+ Add role]                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Data Model

New entity: `customer_entity_roles`

| Column | Type | Notes |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| `id` | uuid | PK |
| `entity_id` | uuid | FK → customer entity (company or person) |
| `user_id` | uuid | FK → staff user |
| `role_type` | varchar | Dictionary-driven: `sales_owner`, `service_owner`, `account_manager`, custom |
| `tenant_id` | uuid | Multi-tenant scoping |
| `organization_id` | uuid | Org scoping |
| `created_at` | timestamp | |
| `updated_at` | timestamp | |

**Unique constraint:** `(entity_id, role_type)` — one user per role type per entity.

#### v1 constraint

In v1, each role type can be assigned to at most one user per entity. Multiple assignees per role type (e.g. two account managers) are explicitly out of scope for this spec. If needed later, this will require revisiting both the unique constraint and the UI (single select → multi-select per role row).

#### Why roles are managed outside CrudForm

Roles are intentionally managed outside CrudForm save because:
- Role assignments are relational records (join table), not simple scalar fields on the entity.
- They may be edited independently by different users (e.g. admin reassigns service owner while sales owner edits company data).
- They benefit from immediate persistence and simpler conflict handling (no merge with CrudForm dirty state).

#### API

```
GET    /api/customers/{companies|people}/{id}/roles
POST   /api/customers/{companies|people}/{id}/roles     { roleType, userId }
PUT    /api/customers/{companies|people}/{id}/roles/{roleId}  { userId }
DELETE /api/customers/{companies|people}/{id}/roles/{roleId}
```

Role types loaded from dictionary: `GET /api/dictionaries?kind=customer-role-types`

#### Behavior

| Rule | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| Save | Independent from CrudForm — roles API is separate CRUD. Same pattern as tags in SPEC-046. |
| User search | Staff user lookup with search: `GET /api/staff?search=query` |
| Default roles | Seeded from dictionary: `sales_owner`, `service_owner`, `account_manager`. Tenant can add custom role types via dictionary management. |
| Display priority | Roles section positioned high in Zone 1 (after "details" group) — business requirement: "must be visible quickly". |

#### CrudForm Integration

```tsx
// In companyEditGroups:
{
  id: 'roles',
  title: t('customers.company.roles.title'),
  column: 1,
  component: ({ values }) => (
    <RolesSection
      entityType="company"
      entityId={values.id as string}
    />
  ),
}
```

| `formConfig.tsx` (company + person) | Modified — add roles group |
| `packages/core/src/modules/customers/acl.ts` | Modified — add `customers.roles.manage` permission |

---

### Enhancement 4: Deal Stage Progress Bar

#### Architecture

Extends the `contentHeader` of SPEC-047 sales document page. Adds a visual pipeline stage bar above the CrudForm.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ contentHeader: DocumentSummaryCard                           │
│                                                              │
│  Order #12345                                    [⚙] [⋯]   │
│  Customer: Acme Corp    Status: In Progress                  │
│                                                              │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ STAGE PROGRESS BAR                                      │ │
│  │                                                         │ │
│  │  [Qualification]──[Proposal]──[Negotiation]──[Closing]  │ │
│  │       ✓              ✓            ●              ○      │ │
│  │                                                         │ │
│  │  ✓ = completed   ● = current   ○ = upcoming            │ │
│  │                                                         │ │
│  │  Click any stage to advance/move deal                   │ │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                                              │
│  [Won ✓]  [Lost ✕]                                          │
│                                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Behavior

| Rule | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| Data source | Pipeline stages from SPEC-028: `GET /api/sales/pipelines/{pipelineId}/stages` |
| Current stage | Mapped from `document.statusEntryId` → pipeline stage |
| Click to advance | Click a future stage → confirm dialog → `PATCH /api/sales/{orders|quotes}/{id}` with new `statusEntryId`. If stage has required fields, dialog shows them before confirming. |
| Click past stage | Click a previous stage → warning: "Move deal back to [stage]?" → confirm → PATCH |
| Visual | Stages always labeled with text (not just color). Completed = filled + checkmark. Current = highlighted + dot. Upcoming = outline. |
| Accessibility | `role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuetext`. Color is never sole indicator — icons + text always present. |
| Won/Lost buttons | Below the progress bar. Trigger `DealClosureDialog`. |

#### Stage transition rules

- Stage transitions are subject to existing sales document edit permissions (`sales.edit`).
- Forward and backward transitions are allowed in v1 unless restricted by pipeline configuration (SPEC-028).
- `won` and `lost` are terminal states from a reporting perspective, but may be reopened by authorized users if the underlying sales domain permits it. **This is an open decision — see Decisions to Confirm.**
- If reopen is not supported by the existing domain model, won/lost must be treated as non-reversible in v1 and the progress bar must visually lock.

#### Won/Lost Flow (DealClosureDialog)

```
User clicks [Won ✓]:
  → Confirmation dialog: "Mark as won?"
  → On confirm: PATCH status to won stage
  → Success animation (confetti/green flash — subtle)

User clicks [Lost ✕]:
  → Dialog with:
    - Loss reason (required, dictionary select: lost_to_competitor, no_budget, 
      no_decision, timing, other)
    - Loss notes (optional textarea)
  → On confirm: PATCH status to lost stage + store loss reason
  → Redirect to pipeline view or stay on card
```

#### API

Stage change uses existing sales API:

```
PATCH /api/sales/{orders|quotes}/{id}
{
  "statusEntryId": "uuid-of-target-stage",
  "closureOutcome": "won" | "lost",     // only on closure
  "lossReasonId": "uuid",                // only when lost
  "lossNotes": "They went with SAP"      // optional
}
```

Loss reasons from dictionary: `GET /api/dictionaries?kind=deal-loss-reasons`

#### Domain effects

This spec defines the card-level closure interaction only. It does not define downstream automations, notifications, forecast updates, or reporting semantics beyond storing:
- `closure_outcome` (won/lost)
- `loss_reason_id` (dictionary reference)
- `loss_notes` (free text)

Any additional side effects (e.g. auto-create project on won, notify manager on lost, update forecast) remain governed by existing sales domain rules, UMES event subscribers, or future specs.

#### Behavior

| Rule | Detail |
| ---- | ------ |
| Planned section | Shows only activities with `scheduledAt` in the future or overdue (`scheduledAt` in the past, not marked done). Always visible above history. |
| Overdue indicator | Red dot + "Overdue" label for activities past `scheduledAt`. Color is NOT sole indicator — text label always present (WCAG). |
| Type filter | Toggle buttons for each activity type. Multiple can be active (OR logic). "All" resets to unfiltered. |
| Date range | Optional date range picker. Filters history timeline only (not planned section). |
| Year dividers | When timeline spans multiple years, show year dividers. Click to scroll-jump (inspired by Tilio). |
| Pin/unpin | Any history entry can be pinned (📌 icon). Pinned items appear in a "Pinned" section above timeline. Unpin removes from section. |
| Persistence | Filter state in URL params: `?activityType=call,email&from=2026-01-01`. Enables shareable filtered views. |

#### Planned vs history contract

Planned/overdue items and historical items are two distinct presentation buckets over the same interaction model (SPEC-046b). The same interaction record must never appear simultaneously in both the planned section and the history section. An interaction transitions from planned to history when it is marked as completed or its `scheduledAt` passes and it is marked done.

#### Filter state source of truth

The URL query string is the source of truth for timeline filter state. On initial render:
1. Parse filters from URL if present.
2. Otherwise use the default unfiltered state.

Local component state should mirror the URL, not replace it. Changing a filter updates both the URL and the component state atomically.

#### API

Extends existing interactions endpoint with filter params:

```
GET /api/customers/interactions?entityType=company&entityId=uuid
    &type=call,email            // optional, comma-separated
    &from=2026-01-01            // optional
    &to=2026-04-06              // optional
    &status=planned|completed   // optional
    &pinned=true                // optional
    &page=1&pageSize=20
```

Pin/unpin:

```
PATCH /api/customers/interactions/{id}
{ "pinned": true }
```

#### Files

| File | Action |
| ---- | ------ |
| `packages/core/src/modules/customers/components/detail/ActivityTimelineFilters.tsx` | New |
| `packages/core/src/modules/customers/components/detail/PlannedActivitiesSection.tsx` | New |
| `packages/core/src/modules/customers/components/detail/ActivityTimeline.tsx` | New — replaces flat list with filtered timeline + year dividers |
| `packages/core/src/modules/customers/components/detail/ActivitiesSection.tsx` | Modified — compose new sub-components |
| `packages/core/src/modules/customers/api/interactions/route.ts` | Modified — add filter params, pin field |
| Migration: `add_pinned_to_interactions` | New — adds `pinned boolean default false` |

## UMES Integration (New Spots)

| Spot | Location | Purpose |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| `detail:customers.company:activity-composer` | Between Zone 1 and Zone 2 | Inject custom activity types or widgets alongside the 4 default types |
| `detail:customers.company:roles` | Roles section | Inject custom role types or role-related widgets |
| `detail:sales.order:stage-bar` | Stage progress bar area | Inject badges, alerts, or widgets alongside the stage bar |
| `detail:sales.order:closure` | Closure dialog | Inject custom closure fields (e.g., competitor name on loss) |

#### UMES extension boundary

Injected widgets in these spots may extend presentation and collect auxiliary data, but must not silently override core save semantics unless explicitly supported by the host contract.

In particular:
- `activity-composer` extensions must not dirty CrudForm.
- `roles` extensions must not bypass role permissions (`customers.roles.manage`).
- `stage-bar` and `closure` extensions must not perform undocumented stage mutations.
- All injected widgets handle their own persistence (triad pattern from SPEC-041 Phase G).

## Risks & Impact Review

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- |
| Collapsible groups break CrudForm validation | High | Fields remain in DOM when collapsed (CSS `display: none` or `height: 0` with `overflow: hidden`, NOT conditional render). Auto-expand on validation error. |
| Zone 1 collapse hides unsaved form changes | Medium | If CrudForm is dirty when user collapses Zone 1, show warning badge on collapsed strip: "Unsaved changes". Expand arrow pulses subtly. Do NOT block collapse — user may intend to review history before saving. |
| Inline activity composer confuses users vs CrudForm save | Medium | Clear visual separation. Composer has its own [Save activity] button, visually distinct from CrudForm [Save]. Toast says "Activity saved" not "Saved". |
| Stage bar click triggers accidental stage change | Medium | Always show confirmation dialog. Undo option in toast for 5 seconds after stage change. |
| Roles migration on large datasets | Low | `customer_entity_roles` is a new table — no existing data migration needed. Seed dictionary only. |
| Activity filtering degrades performance on large histories | Medium | Server-side pagination + filtering. Default page size 20. Index on `(entity_id, type, occurred_at)`. |
| WCAG compliance across new components | High | No color-only indicators. All interactive elements 44x44px touch target. Keyboard navigation for stage bar. `aria-*` attributes on all new components. Test with screen reader before release. |
| Multiple independent save surfaces on one page cause user confusion | Medium | Distinguish CrudForm save vs activity/roles save visually and textually. Use action-specific success toasts ("Aktywność zapisana", "Rola przypisana") — never generic "Saved". Different button colors for CrudForm Save (primary/yellow) vs activity Save (green/secondary). |
| localStorage persistence drift across devices/browsers | Low | Accept as v1 limitation. Collapse/filter preferences are per-device. Document future migration path to user preferences API in Phase 5+. |

## Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] Collapsible groups: `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, keyboard toggle (Enter/Space)
- [ ] Activity composer: logical focus order when expanded, autofocus first editable field, Escape to close if empty or after confirmation when dirty
- [ ] Activity type icons: `aria-label` on each, keyboard selectable
- [ ] Stage bar: `role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuetext`, keyboard arrows to navigate stages
- [ ] Overdue indicators: text label always present alongside color
- [ ] All buttons: 44x44px minimum touch target
- [ ] All animations: respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [ ] Closure dialog: focus trap, Escape to close, return focus to trigger on close

---

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why rejected |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Three-column layout (left/right/top) instead of two-zone | SPEC-046 two-zone is already implemented and working. contentHeader serves as the "top zone". Adding a third column would require rewriting CrudForm layout engine — too much work for marginal gain. |
| Modal for activity creation | Meeting consensus: modals add friction. Inline is faster for CRM power users. All competitive CRMs (Bitrix, Dynamics) are moving away from modals for high-frequency actions. |
| Single "owner" field with multiple selection | Multi-select loses role context. A user assigned to a company could be sales or service — the role label matters for workflows and reporting. |
| Kanban as primary deal view instead of progress bar | Kanban is a list-level view (pipeline overview). Progress bar is a card-level view (single deal context). Both needed — progress bar on card, kanban on list page. Not competing solutions. |

## Decisions to Confirm Before Implementation

| # | Decision | Default assumption | Impact if changed |
| - | -------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 1 | Are `won` and `lost` reversible in v1? | Non-reversible — progress bar locks on closure | If reversible: need "Reopen" button, stage bar unlocking logic, audit trail entry |
| 2 | Are backward stage transitions always allowed, or pipeline-configurable? | Always allowed in v1 with confirmation dialog | If configurable: need per-pipeline `allowBackward` flag, UI must read it |
| 3 | Is one assignee per role type a permanent v1 rule? | Yes — unique `(entity_id, role_type)` | If multiple: change to non-unique, UI from select → multi-select, different card layout |
| 4 | Is localStorage-only persistence acceptable for initial rollout? | Yes — collapse/filter state per-device only | If not: need user preferences API endpoint before Phase 1 |
| 5 | Should activity creation use optimistic update or mandatory refetch? | Optimistic prepend if response payload sufficient | If refetch: slower perceived UX, but simpler implementation |
| 6 | Can UMES extensions in stage/closure areas participate in validation, or presentation only? | Presentation only — extensions cannot block stage transitions | If validation: need extension validation contract, async validation pipeline |
