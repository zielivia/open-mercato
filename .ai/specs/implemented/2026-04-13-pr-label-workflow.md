# SPEC: PR Label Workflow — Streamlined Review & QA Pipeline

**Date**: 2026-04-13
**Status**: Partially Implemented
**Author**: Piotr Karwatka + Claude

---

## Problem

The repository has **50+ labels**, many redundant or unused. Key issues:

| Problem | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Duplicate labels** | `merge-queue` vs `merge queue`, `changes-requested` vs `changes requested`, `approved` vs `PR review accepted` |
| **Unused/stale labels** | `PR review`, `discussion`, `failing-ci`, `preview-env`, `changes-resolved`, `CLA`, `bounty-hunting` |
| **No clear QA gate** | QA labels exist (`QA in progress`, `QA confirmed`, `QA: Fixes required`) but aren't wired into any automated flow |
| **No single source of truth** | A PR can have `approved` + `changes-requested` simultaneously — no state machine |
| **Skills and humans out of sync** | `auto-review-pr` skill sets `merge-queue`/`changes-requested`, but humans use different label names |

## Design Principles

1. **Labels are a state machine** — a PR is in exactly one pipeline state at a time
2. **Minimal label set** — fewer labels = less confusion, easier to enforce
3. **Skills and humans use the same labels** — one flow for both
4. **Parallel tracks** — CI, code review, and QA run concurrently where possible
5. **GitHub-native** — use `gh` CLI and GitHub Actions; no external tools

---

## Proposed Label Set

### Pipeline State Labels (mutually exclusive — only ONE at a time)

These track where a PR is in the pipeline. The `auto-review-pr` skill, QA humans, and merge automation all operate on these.

| Label | Color | Set by | Meaning |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| `review` | `#1d76db` blue | Author / automation | PR is ready for code review (human or skill) |
| `changes-requested` | `#BA6609` orange | Reviewer / skill | Code review found issues; author must fix |
| `qa` | `#12B0D1` cyan | Reviewer / skill | Code review passed → waiting for QA testing |
| `qa-failed` | `#bfb420` yellow | QA tester | QA found issues; author must fix |
| `merge-queue` | `#0E8A16` green | QA / reviewer | All gates passed → ready to merge |
| `blocked` | `#aaaaaa` grey | Anyone | Blocked on external dependency or decision |
| `do-not-merge` | `#DF0D61` red | Anyone | Explicitly held from merging (WIP, discussion, etc.) |

### Category Labels (additive — multiple allowed)

These classify what the PR is about. Applied once, never removed.

| Label | Color | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `bug` | `#d73a4a` | Bug fix |
| `feature` | `#1a714e` | New feature |
| `refactor` | `#6442dc` | Code refactoring |
| `security` | `#D93F0B` | Security fix or hardening |
| `dependencies` | `#0366d6` | Dependency updates (Dependabot) |
| `enterprise` | `#aaaaaa` | Enterprise-only change |
| `documentation` | `#0075ca` | Documentation-only or documentation-heavy change |

### Meta Labels (additive — situational)

| Label | Color | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `needs-qa` | `#d876e3` purple | PR requires manual QA before merge (set by author or reviewer) |
| `skip-qa` | `#c5def5` light blue | Explicitly mark that QA is not needed (docs, deps, CI-only) |
| `in-progress` | `#fbca04` amber | An auto-skill (or human) is actively working on this PR/issue right now — concurrency lock |

### Priority Labels (mutually exclusive within group — at most one)

These communicate urgency on issues and PRs. They are additive relative to category/meta labels, but only one priority label may be applied at a time. The default — when no priority label is present — is treated as `priority-medium`.

| Label | Color | When to apply |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| `priority-low` | `#C2E0C6` pale green | Cosmetic, opportunistic, or follow-up cleanup work; can wait several cycles |
| `priority-medium` | `#FBCA04` yellow | Default working priority for normal feature/bug work |
| `priority-high` | `#FF8A65` orange | Release-blocking — must land before the next release |
| `priority-extreme` | `#B60205` deep red | Drop everything: production outage, active data-loss bug, or security incident |

Rules:

- Issues and PRs SHOULD carry a priority label. If absent, treat as `priority-medium`.
- Triage MUST replace any existing priority label rather than stacking — use `gh issue edit <n> --remove-label priority-low --add-label priority-high` (or the GraphQL helper used elsewhere).
- `priority-extreme` MUST be paired with an explanatory comment naming the incident/outage and the on-call owner.
- Auto-skills MUST NOT set or change priority labels on their own; human triage owns priority. The only exception is `priority-extreme` on confirmed CI-breaking or security-impacting regressions, which an auto-skill MAY apply with an explanatory comment.

**Total: 21 labels** (down from 50+; 17 from the original spec plus 4 priority labels added 2026-05-04).

### State Transitions (explicit rules)

| From | To | Trigger | Who |
|------|----|---------|-----|
| *(new PR)* | `review` | PR opened/ready for review | Author |
| `review` | `changes-requested` | Code review finds issues | `auto-review-pr` skill or human reviewer |
| `review` | `qa` | Code review approves + `needs-qa` present | `auto-review-pr` skill or human reviewer |
| `review` | `merge-queue` | Code review approves + no `needs-qa` | `auto-review-pr` skill or human reviewer |
| `changes-requested` | `review` | Author pushes fixes | Author (or automation on push) |
| `qa` | `merge-queue` | QA passes | QA tester |
| `qa` | `qa-failed` | QA finds issues | QA tester |
| `qa-failed` | `qa` | Author pushes fixes | Author |
| *(any)* | `blocked` | External blocker | Anyone |
| *(any)* | `do-not-merge` | Hold from merge | Anyone |
| `blocked` | `review` | Blocker resolved | Anyone |

---

## Concurrency Control — In-Progress Markers

Auto-skills (`auto-review-pr`, `code-review`, `auto-fix-github`, `review-prs`, `merge-buddy`, plus any future automation) MUST claim a PR or issue before mutating it, and MUST refuse to claim something that is already in progress unless the user explicitly forces the run. This prevents two parallel skill invocations (or a skill and a human) from stomping on each other.

### Three signals (used together)

| Signal | Owner | Role |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Assignee** (GitHub native) | The actor doing the work | Strongest "owned right now" signal; visible in PR/issue list filters |
| **`in-progress` label** | The actor doing the work | Quick programmatic filter; cleared on completion |
| **Comment** | The actor doing the work | Auditable timeline trail with skill name + timestamp |

The assignee is the source of truth for *who* owns it. The label is the source of truth for *whether* a skill currently owns it. The comment is the audit trail.

### Claim protocol (every auto-skill MUST follow)

#### Before doing any work — pre-claim check

1. Fetch current state:
   ```bash
   gh pr view {number} --json assignees,labels,number,title
   # or for issues:
   gh issue view {number} --json assignees,labels,number,title
   ```

2. Determine if it is already in progress:
   - Has the `in-progress` label, OR
   - Has any assignee that is **not** the current GitHub user (`gh api user --jq '.login'`), OR
   - Has a "claim comment" within the last 30 minutes from another actor

3. If already in progress AND `--force` was NOT passed:
   - **STOP**. Do not claim. Do not start work.
   - Ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion` or equivalent prompt) whether to override and force the run.
   - Only continue if the user explicitly says yes (which is treated as the same as `--force`).

4. If already in progress AND `--force` was passed (or user just confirmed):
   - Post a comment noting that the previous claim was overridden and continue.

#### Claim — when starting work

Once cleared, mark the resource as in-progress:

```bash
CURRENT_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login')

# Assign to current user (idempotent — adds without removing other assignees)
gh pr edit {number} --add-assignee "$CURRENT_USER"
# or for issues:
gh issue edit {number} --add-assignee "$CURRENT_USER"

# Apply the in-progress label (and remove the inverse pipeline label if applicable)
# Use the existing GraphQL label flow from auto-review-pr

# Post a claim comment
gh pr comment {number} --body "🤖 \`{skill-name}\` started by @${CURRENT_USER} at $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ). Other auto-skills will skip this {PR|issue} until the lock is released."
```

#### Release — when finishing work

Always release the lock, even on failure:

```bash
# Remove the in-progress label
# (use GraphQL to atomically remove)

# Post a completion comment with the verdict
gh pr comment {number} --body "🤖 \`{skill-name}\` completed: {verdict-summary}"

# For auto-review-pr: keep the assignee so the human reviewer / next-step owner is visible
# For auto-fix-github: keep the assignee (the user owns the resulting PR)
```

If the skill exits abnormally (process killed, exception unhandled), the next invocation MUST treat a stale `in-progress` label older than 60 minutes as expired and offer to take over (still with `--force` if a different user holds the assignee).

### `--force` flag

Every auto-skill that mutates a PR or issue MUST accept a `--force` flag (or equivalent positional argument). When set:

- Skip the in-progress check
- Post a "force override" comment naming the previous assignee/label state
- Continue with the claim

When the flag is **not** set and the resource is in progress, the skill MUST ask the user before proceeding. Silent override is forbidden — a parallel auto-run could be doing legitimate work.

### Examples

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| User runs `/auto-review-pr 1234` and PR has no `in-progress` label and no assignee | Claim and proceed |
| User runs `/auto-review-pr 1234` and PR is assigned to another user | Stop, ask "Override @other-user's claim?" |
| User runs `/auto-review-pr 1234 --force` on a PR locked by another skill | Force, post override comment, proceed |
| Background `/review-prs` triage hits a PR already locked by `/auto-review-pr` | Skip silently, log "skipped: in progress" in summary |
| `/auto-fix-github 999` and issue is assigned to a human contributor | Stop, ask "Override @contributor's claim?" |
| `/auto-fix-github 999 --force` overrides a stale (>60min) lock | Force, post override comment, continue |

### Skip-when-in-progress in batch skills

`review-prs` and `merge-buddy` operate over many PRs at once. They MUST:

- Skip any PR with the `in-progress` label or with an assignee that is not the current user
- Report the skipped PRs in the final summary table with reason "in progress"
- Never auto-force inside a batch — forcing is an explicit, per-PR user decision

---

## Skill Integration Changes

### `auto-review-pr` skill changes

Current behavior already uses `merge-queue` and `changes-requested`. Changes needed:

1. **Pre-claim check** (see Concurrency Control above) — at the very start, before fetching metadata or creating a worktree, run the in-progress check; stop and ask the user (or honor `--force`) if locked
2. **Claim on start** — assign the PR to the current GitHub user, apply `in-progress` label, post a claim comment
3. **Release on finish** — remove `in-progress`, post a completion comment with the verdict; keep the assignee
4. **Add `review` label awareness** — when starting a review, verify PR has `review` label (or apply it)
5. **QA gate logic** — after approving:
   - If `needs-qa` label is present → set `qa` label (not `merge-queue`)
   - If `needs-qa` absent → set `merge-queue` label (current behavior)
6. **Remove old label names** — stop referencing `approved`, `merge queue` (space), `changes requested` (space)
7. **Label transition helper** — extract a shared `setPipelineLabel(prNumber, newLabel)` function that:
   - Adds the new pipeline label
   - Removes all other pipeline labels
   - Uses GraphQL (current approach) for atomicity
8. **`--force` flag** — accept `--force` (or trailing `force` argument) to bypass the in-progress check; document it in the skill's argument list

### `auto-fix-github` skill changes

1. **Pre-claim check** (see Concurrency Control above) — at the very start, before fetching the issue body or creating a worktree, run the in-progress check on the issue; stop and ask the user (or honor `--force`) if locked
2. **Claim on start** — assign the **issue** to the current GitHub user, apply `in-progress` label on the issue, post a claim comment on the issue
3. **Release on finish** — when the PR is opened, remove the `in-progress` label from the issue and post a completion comment linking the new PR; keep the issue assignee so it remains visible who owns the work
4. When opening a PR, apply `review` label on the PR (and run the same claim protocol on the new PR if any auto-review will follow)
5. Apply `skip-qa` for small/trivial fixes (single-file, test-only, etc.)
6. **`--force` flag** — accept `--force` (or trailing `force` argument) to bypass the in-progress check and override existing assignees/labels

### `check-and-commit` skill changes

No changes needed — operates before PR creation.

### New skill: `merge-buddy`

A triage skill invoked via `/merge-buddy`. Scans **all open PRs** and produces a merge-readiness report — a table of PRs that can be merged right now (zero blockers) plus a secondary table of PRs that are close but have specific remaining issues.

#### Workflow

1. **Fetch all open PRs** with metadata:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state open --json number,title,url,author,labels,reviewDecision,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,headRefName,baseRefName,updatedAt,isDraft --limit 100
   ```

2. **For each PR, collect gate status**:
   - **CI status**: `gh pr checks <number> --json name,state` — all required checks must be `SUCCESS`
   - **Review decision**: must be `APPROVED` (from `reviewDecision`)
   - **Mergeable**: `mergeable` must be `MERGEABLE`, `mergeStateStatus` must not be `DIRTY` or `BLOCKED`
   - **Not draft**: `isDraft` must be `false`
   - **No blocking labels**: must not have `changes-requested`, `qa-failed`, `blocked`, `do-not-merge`
   - **Not in progress**: must not have `in-progress` label (another auto-skill is mid-run); skip silently with reason "in progress"
   - **QA gate**: if `needs-qa` is present, must also have `merge-queue` label (meaning QA passed)
   - **No merge conflicts**: `mergeable !== 'CONFLICTING'`

3. **Classify each PR** into one of:
   - **Ready to merge** — all gates pass
   - **Almost ready** — only 1-2 minor blockers (e.g., CI pending, awaiting review but no changes requested)
   - **Blocked** — has hard blockers (conflicts, `do-not-merge`, failing CI, changes requested)

4. **Output a formatted report**:

   ```
   ## Merge Buddy Report — {date}

   ### Ready to Merge (X PRs)

   | # | Title | Author | Labels | Age |
   |---|-------|--------|--------|-----|
   | [#123](url) | Fix auth flow | @alice | `bug` | 2d |

   ### Almost Ready (Y PRs)

   | # | Title | Author | Blocker | Action needed |
   |---|-------|--------|---------|---------------|
   | [#456](url) | Add catalog search | @bob | CI pending | Wait ~5min or re-run |

   ### Blocked (Z PRs)

   | # | Title | Blocker(s) |
   |---|-------|------------|
   | [#789](url) | Refactor events | Merge conflicts, changes-requested |
   ```

5. **For "Ready to Merge" PRs**, offer to merge them (ask user for confirmation before each merge or offer a "merge all" option).

#### Rules

- Never merge without explicit user confirmation
- Sort "Ready to Merge" by age (oldest first — clear the backlog)
- Sort "Almost Ready" by how close they are (fewest blockers first)
- Skip draft PRs entirely from the report
- The report must be concise — no PR descriptions, just the table
- If zero PRs are ready, say so clearly and highlight the top "Almost Ready" candidates

### New skill: `review-prs`

A **day-start triage skill** invoked via `/review-prs`. Finds all open PRs that have not been reviewed yet and reviews them one by one, starting from the most recent. Designed as a morning routine — run it at the start of your day to clear the review backlog.

#### Workflow

1. **Fetch open PRs needing review**:
   ```bash
   gh pr list --state open --json number,title,url,author,labels,reviewDecision,createdAt,updatedAt,isDraft --limit 50
   ```

2. **Filter to unreviewed PRs**:
   - `reviewDecision` is `null` or empty (no review submitted yet)
   - Not a draft (`isDraft === false`)
   - Does not have `do-not-merge` or `blocked` labels (skip held PRs)
   - Does not have `in-progress` label and has no assignee other than the current user (concurrency lock — see Concurrency Control above)
   - Author is not the current user (don't self-review)

3. **Sort by recency** — most recently created first (clear fresh PRs before stale ones).

4. **Present the queue**:
   ```
   ## Review Queue — {date}

   Found {N} unreviewed PRs (newest first):

   | # | Title | Author | Created | Labels |
   |---|-------|--------|---------|--------|
   | [#456](url) | Add catalog search | @bob | 2h ago | `feature` |
   | [#445](url) | Fix auth redirect | @alice | 1d ago | `bug` |
   ```

5. **Sequential review loop** — for each PR in the queue:
   a. Show: `Reviewing PR #{number}: {title} ({N} of {total})`
   b. Invoke the full `auto-review-pr` skill (including autofix flow)
   c. After review completes, show the verdict and move to the next PR
   d. Between reviews, briefly report progress: `Reviewed {done}/{total}. Next: #{number}`

6. **Final summary** after all reviews:
   ```
   ## Review Session Complete

   | # | Title | Verdict | Label |
   |---|-------|---------|-------|
   | #456 | Add catalog search | APPROVED | merge-queue |
   | #445 | Fix auth redirect | CHANGES REQUESTED (auto-fixed → APPROVED) | merge-queue |

   Reviewed: {N} PRs
   Approved: {X}
   Changes requested: {Y} ({Z} auto-fixed)
   ```

#### Rules

- Always start from the most recent unreviewed PR
- Never skip a PR silently — if a PR can't be reviewed (e.g., CI not finished), note it and move on
- Use the full `auto-review-pr` skill for each PR (with autofix)
- After the review session, optionally invoke `merge-buddy` to show what's now ready to merge
- If there are zero unreviewed PRs, say so and suggest running `/merge-buddy` instead

### QA helper commands

Add convenience commands to `AGENTS.md` or a lightweight skill:

```bash
# QA approves a PR
gh pr edit <number> --remove-label "qa" --add-label "merge-queue"

# QA rejects a PR
gh pr edit <number> --remove-label "qa" --add-label "qa-failed"

# Author requests re-QA after fix
gh pr edit <number> --remove-label "qa-failed" --add-label "qa"
```

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Label Cleanup (gh CLI)

Delete redundant/unused labels and normalize names.

**Labels to DELETE** (27 labels):

```
# Duplicates (keeping the hyphenated versions)
merge queue
changes requested
PR review accepted
approved
PR review

# Unused / stale
good first issue
help wanted
invalid
wontfix
duplicate
question
resolved
needs-info
needs-response
stale
discussion
failing-ci
changes-resolved
CLA
bounty-hunting
preview-env
codex
framework
domain
integration
quality improvement
for-core-contributors
```

**Labels to RENAME**:

| Old name | New name |
|----------|----------|
| `QA in progress` | *(delete — replaced by `qa`)* |
| `QA confirmed` | *(delete — replaced by `merge-queue`)* |
| `QA: Fixes required` | *(delete — replaced by `qa-failed`)* |
| `do not merge` | `do-not-merge` *(normalize)* |
| `javascript` | *(delete — not useful)* |
| `github_actions` | *(delete — not useful)* |
| `released` | *(delete — use GitHub releases instead)* |
| `ui` | *(delete — not used consistently)* |
| `missing-integration-tests` | *(delete — code review covers this)* |
| `rejected` | *(delete — use `changes-requested` or close PR)* |

**Labels to CREATE**:

| Name | Color | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `review` | `#1d76db` | Ready for code review |
| `qa` | `#12B0D1` | Waiting for QA testing |
| `qa-failed` | `#bfb420` | QA found issues |
| `needs-qa` | `#d876e3` | Requires manual QA before merge |
| `skip-qa` | `#c5def5` | QA not required |
| `in-progress` | `#fbca04` | Auto-skill (or human) is actively working — concurrency lock |

**Labels to KEEP** (already correct):

| Name | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `merge-queue` | Already used by `auto-review-pr` skill |
| `changes-requested` | Already used by `auto-review-pr` skill |
| `blocked` | Keep as-is |
| `do-not-merge` | Rename from `do not merge` |
| `bug` | Category |
| `feature` | Category |
| `refactor` | Category |
| `security` | Category |
| `dependencies` | Category (Dependabot) |
| `enterprise` | Category |
| `documentation` | Category |
| `enhancement` | *(merge into `feature`? or keep for minor improvements)* |

### Phase 2: Skill Updates

1. Update `auto-review-pr` SKILL.md — add QA gate logic and `review` label handling
2. Update `auto-fix-github` SKILL.md — apply `review` + optional `skip-qa` on PR creation
3. Extract `setPipelineLabel` helper into a shared skill utility or inline in both skills
4. Create `merge-buddy` skill — `.ai/skills/merge-buddy/SKILL.md` — scan all open PRs, classify merge-readiness, output actionable table
5. Create `review-prs` skill — `.ai/skills/review-prs/SKILL.md` — day-start triage that reviews all unreviewed PRs (newest first) using the `auto-review-pr` skill, then optionally runs `merge-buddy`

### Phase 3: AGENTS.md Updates

1. Add **PR Workflow** section to root `AGENTS.md` documenting the label state machine
2. Add QA quick-reference commands
3. Document when to apply `needs-qa` vs `skip-qa`:
   - `needs-qa`: UI changes, new features, sales/order flows, anything customer-facing
   - `skip-qa`: dependency bumps, docs, CI config, refactors with full test coverage, typo fixes

### Phase 4: Automation (optional, GitHub Actions)

A lightweight workflow that enforces the state machine:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-labels.yml
# On PR labeled/unlabeled:
#   - Ensure only one pipeline label exists
#   - On push to PR with changes-requested → auto-switch to review
#   - On push to PR with qa-failed → auto-switch to qa
```

---

## Migration

1. Run Phase 1 label cleanup script (single `gh` session)
2. Re-label open PRs with new labels based on their current state
3. Update skills (Phase 2)
4. Update AGENTS.md (Phase 3)
5. Announce to team

### Migration Script (Phase 1)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run from repo root with gh authenticated

## Implementation Status

| Phase | Status | Date | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| Phase 1 — Label Cleanup | Done | 2026-04-14 | Repository labels normalized with `gh`; legacy labels removed or renamed; existing open PR pipeline labels were remapped to the new state machine |
| Phase 2 — Skill Updates | Done | 2026-04-14 | `auto-review-pr` and `auto-fix-github` updated; `merge-buddy` and `review-prs` skills added |
| Phase 3 — AGENTS.md Updates | Done | 2026-04-14 | Root `AGENTS.md` documents the PR workflow, QA routing, and `gh` helper commands |
| Phase 4 — Automation | Not Started | — | Optional GitHub Actions enforcement remains deferred |
| Phase 5 — Priority Labels | Done | 2026-05-04 | Added `priority-low/medium/high/extreme` to communicate urgency on issues and PRs; documented in this spec and root `AGENTS.md` |

## Open Questions

1. **Auto-merge on `merge-queue`?** — Should we add a GitHub Action that auto-merges when `merge-queue` is applied and CI is green?
2. **Who decides `needs-qa`?** — Author on PR creation, or reviewer during code review? (Spec assumes: either, but reviewer has final say)
4. **Dependabot PRs** — Auto-apply `skip-qa` + `review` on Dependabot PRs?
