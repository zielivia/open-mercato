# Upgrade Notes

Open Mercato `0.5.0` is our biggest release so far. It bundles more than 250 fixes and
improvements that landed after the Hackathon in Sopot, alongside several important
dependency and tooling upgrades. That combination is exactly why this document now exists:
to give downstream app and module authors one place to review the upgrade work that may
require code changes on their side.

This document lists backward-incompatible changes that users of the Open Mercato platform
must apply to their own modules, apps, and extensions when upgrading between framework
versions. It only covers **actionable** incompatibilities — library behavior that affects
code a downstream module author can plausibly write against.

For the platform's own contract-surface stability guarantees, see
[`BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`](BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md).

For user-facing release highlights see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

Companion AI skills (one per upgrade window) live in
[`.ai/skills/auto-upgrade-<from>-<to>/SKILL.md`](.ai/skills/) and can mechanically migrate
most of the patterns listed below in a user's codebase.

## 0.4.10 → 0.5.0 (unreleased)

Release context:
- Biggest Open Mercato release so far
- More than 250 fixes and improvements delivered after the Hackathon in Sopot
- Includes several major dependency upgrades, which is why `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` was added
  for this release window

This window bundles the consolidated Dependabot dependency bumps from
[#1620](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/1620) (minor/patch) and
[#1621](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/1621) (major), migrated to
`develop` in [#1625](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/1625).

Three major bumps with deep platform surface impact were **deliberately reverted** and are
**NOT** part of 0.5.0 — they remain on their 0.4.10 versions and are tracked as separate
dedicated upgrades. See [Deferred majors](#deferred-majors) below.

Companion skill: [`auto-upgrade-0.4.10-to-0.5.0`](.ai/skills/auto-upgrade-0.4.10-to-0.5.0/SKILL.md).

### Breaking dependency changes that may affect user code

#### `meilisearch` `^0.55` → `^1.0`

The exported client class was renamed from `MeiliSearch` to `Meilisearch` (lowercase `s`),
and the package switched to pure ESM (`"type": "module"`).

Code changes:

```ts
// before
import { MeiliSearch } from 'meilisearch'
const client = new MeiliSearch({ host, apiKey })

// after
import { Meilisearch } from 'meilisearch'
const client = new Meilisearch({ host, apiKey })
```

Jest configuration (ESM): Jest's default `transformIgnorePatterns` skips `node_modules`.
Since `meilisearch@1` ships pure ESM, add an allow-list so `ts-jest`/`babel-jest` can
transform it:

```js
// apps/<your-app>/jest.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  // ...
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    '/node_modules/(?!meilisearch)/',
    '\\.pnp\\.[^\\/]+$',
  ],
}
```

#### `stripe` `^17` → `^22`

The `Stripe.LatestApiVersion` namespace constant was removed and the zero-argument
`stripe.accounts.retrieve()` was replaced by `stripe.accounts.retrieveCurrent()`.

Code changes:

```ts
// before
import Stripe from 'stripe'
const stripe = new Stripe(apiKey, {
  apiVersion: apiVersion as Stripe.LatestApiVersion,
})
const account = await stripe.accounts.retrieve()

// after
import Stripe from 'stripe'
type StripeConfig = NonNullable<ConstructorParameters<typeof Stripe>[1]>
const stripe = new Stripe(apiKey, {
  apiVersion: apiVersion as StripeConfig['apiVersion'],
})
const account = await stripe.accounts.retrieveCurrent()
```

Also bumped in lock-step: `@stripe/react-stripe-js` `^3` → `^6`, `@stripe/stripe-js`
`^7` → `^9`. Consult Stripe's own migration guides for component-level API changes.

#### `lucide-react` `^0.556` → `^1.8`

Brand icons `Linkedin` and `Twitter` were removed for trademark reasons. Replace with
a semantic substitute (the platform uses `Briefcase` for LinkedIn-style links and
`AtSign` for Twitter-style handles):

```tsx
// before
import { Linkedin, Twitter } from 'lucide-react'

// after
import { Briefcase, AtSign } from 'lucide-react'
```

Other lucide icon name stabilizations landed in the v1 cut — check your imports
against https://lucide.dev/icons if you see "module has no exported member" errors.

Server-side navigation metadata:

If you store page, sidebar, or settings-navigation icons in backend metadata that is
serialized on the server, do **not** pass Lucide component references or JSX elements such
as `icon: Users` or `icon: <Users />`. After the v1 upgrade these can cross the
server/client boundary and break routes such as `/api/auth/admin/nav`.

Use one of these patterns instead:

```ts
// preferred for backend/page metadata
icon: 'users'
```

```ts
// also safe when you need a custom shape
const usersIcon = React.createElement(
  'svg',
  { width: 16, height: 16, viewBox: '0 0 24 24', fill: 'none', stroke: 'currentColor', strokeWidth: 2 },
  React.createElement('path', { d: 'M16 21v-2a4 4 0 0 0-4-4H6a4 4 0 0 0-4 4v2' }),
  React.createElement('circle', { cx: 9, cy: 7, r: 4 }),
)

icon: usersIcon
```

If your admin navigation starts failing with an error about calling
`node_modules/lucide-react/dist/esm/Icon.js` from the server, audit every metadata-driven
icon in that nav path and replace component references with icon names or inline SVG.

#### `react-markdown` `^9` → `^10`

The `className` prop was removed from `<ReactMarkdown>`. Wrap the invocation in a
`<div>` that carries the class instead:

```tsx
// before
<ReactMarkdown className="prose" remarkPlugins={plugins}>{body}</ReactMarkdown>

// after
<div className="prose">
  <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={plugins}>{body}</ReactMarkdown>
</div>
```

#### `cron-parser` `^4` → `^5`

The default-export factory was removed. `parseExpression` is no longer a function exposed
on the default import — use the named `CronExpressionParser.parse` static method:

```ts
// before
import parser from 'cron-parser'
const expr = parser.parseExpression('*/5 * * * *')

// after
import { CronExpressionParser } from 'cron-parser'
const expr = CronExpressionParser.parse('*/5 * * * *')
```

The returned iterator shape (`next()`, `prev()`, `hasNext()`, `hasPrev()`) is unchanged.

#### `@simplewebauthn/server` `^11` → `^13` (and `@simplewebauthn/types` `^11` → `^12`)

Function signatures were narrowed from `Uint8Array` to `Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>`. A
`TextEncoder().encode(...)` result or a `new Uint8Array(Buffer.from(...))` result is
typed `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` and is no longer assignable. Coerce with `.slice()`:

```ts
// before
function toWebAuthnUserId(userId: string): Uint8Array {
  return new TextEncoder().encode(userId)
}
function base64UrlToBytes(value: string): Uint8Array {
  return new Uint8Array(Buffer.from(value, 'base64url'))
}

// after
function toWebAuthnUserId(userId: string) {
  return new TextEncoder().encode(userId).slice()
}
function base64UrlToBytes(value: string) {
  return new Uint8Array(Buffer.from(value, 'base64url')).slice()
}
```

Several exported types also moved from `@simplewebauthn/types@11` to `@simplewebauthn/types@12`.
If you imported passkey types directly, re-run `tsc` — the message is usually the rename is
transparent once the new version is installed.

#### `recharts` `^2` → `^3`

recharts 3 dropped several default props (e.g. `isAnimationActive`) and tightened the
`ResponsiveContainer` width/height typing. If you render charts in a custom module, expect
to audit any non-default props, particularly custom `Tooltip`/`Legend` content renderers,
which now receive slightly different payload shapes. No helper is provided here — review
https://recharts.org upgrade notes.

#### `rate-limiter-flexible` `^9` → `^11`

Two back-to-back major releases. The constructor options object is mostly compatible; the
main breakage is around the deprecated `pointsConsumed` return field and the strictened
Redis client option type (`useRedisPackage`/`storeClient` unioning). Audit any direct
consumers — the platform itself uses this transitively; user modules that wire their own
`RateLimiterRedis` instance are the ones to watch.

#### `framer-motion` `^11` → `^12`

Most `motion.<el>` call sites continue to work. The layout animation engine was rewritten
and some auto-animated layout transitions now behave slightly differently at the pixel
level. Bug-for-bug parity is not guaranteed; verify any long-running, scroll-triggered, or
gesture-driven animations after upgrading.

#### `glob` `^11` → `^13`

Node 20+ now required. The `Glob` class `matchBase` option was renamed to `matchBases`; the
function signature already accepted `signal` and `withFileTypes`. If you used the
`globSync()` one-shot helper, no code change is needed.

#### `esbuild` `^0.25` → `^0.28`

Only affects build tooling in workspace packages that ship a standalone bundle
(`packages/create-app`, `packages/cli`, `packages/checkout`, `packages/scheduler`,
`packages/webhooks`, `packages/sync-akeneo`). The 0.25→0.28 window made `--outdir` with a
non-existent directory error (previously it silently created it); ensure your build scripts
`mkdir -p` explicitly. No runtime behavior change.

#### `eslint` `^9` → `^10`

Flat config is now the only config format (`.eslintrc.*` is removed). If you still ship a
legacy `.eslintrc.js` in a user module, migrate it to `eslint.config.mjs`. ESLint 10 also
drops Node 18 support — make sure your CI runs Node 20+ at minimum.

#### `rimraf` `^5` → `^6`

Pure tooling change. The default-exported function is now async-only and no longer accepts
the legacy callback signature. If you invoke `rimraf` from a build script, `await` it.

#### `@docusaurus/*` `^3.9` → `^3.10`

Minor bump. No user code changes. The consolidation pins `webpack` to `5.104.1` via
root-level `resolutions` because `webpackbar@6.0.1` (a transitive of `@docusaurus/core@3.10`)
is incompatible with webpack `5.106.x`'s stricter `ProgressPlugin` schema. The pin can be
dropped once `webpackbar` ships a fix or Docusaurus bumps it.

#### AI SDK family

`@ai-sdk/amazon-bedrock` `^4.0.8` → `^4.0.96`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` `^3.0.12` → `^3.0.71`,
`@ai-sdk/cohere` `^3.0.4` → `^3.0.30`, `@ai-sdk/google` `^2` → `^3`, `@ai-sdk/mistral`
`^3.0.5` → `^3.0.30`, `@ai-sdk/openai` `^3.0.5` → `^3.0.53`, `ai` `^6.0.0` → `^6.0.168`,
`ai-sdk-ollama` `3.0.0` → `3.8.3`.

`@ai-sdk/google` is the only major bump here. v3 renamed the default model factory export
and tightened the tool-call result shape; if you import `google` directly and call `.tool()`
or pass a custom fetch, verify against v3 release notes.

#### Miscellaneous smaller bumps (no known user-code impact)

- `next` `16.2.3` → `16.2.4`, `react`/`react-dom` `19.2.1` → `19.2.5`.
- `@tanstack/react-query` `^5.90.12` → `^5.99.2`.
- `@types/node` `^20`/`^24` → `^25`, `@types/react` `^19.2.7` → `^19.2.14`.
- `newrelic` `^13.16` → `^13.19`, `dotenv` `^17.2.3` → `^17.4.2`, `resend` `^6.5.2` → `^6.12.0`.
- `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `tailwindcss` `^4.1.17` → `^4.2.2`, `tailwind-merge` `^3.4.0` → `^3.5.0`.
- `better-sqlite3` `^12.5` → `^12.9`, `bullmq` `^5.34` → `^5.75`, `ioredis` `^5.8` → `^5.10`.
- `zod` `^4.1.13` → `^4.3.6`, `semver` `^7.7.3` → `^7.7.4`, `testcontainers` `^11.12` → `^11.14`.
- `jest` `^30.2` → `^30.3`, `jest-environment-jsdom` `^30.2` → `^30.3`, `ts-jest` `^29.4.6` → `^29.4.9`.
- `eslint-config-next` `16.1.7` → `16.2.4`.
- `@react-email/components` `^1.0.1` → `^1.0.12`, `react-email` `^5.2.10` → `^6.0.0`.
  react-email v6 changed the CLI entry from `email` to `react-email`; if you scripted the
  CLI, update the command name.
- `@uiw/react-markdown-preview` `^5.1.5` → `^5.2.0`, `@uiw/react-md-editor` `^4.0.11` → `^4.1.0`.
- `openid-client` `^6.3.3` → `^6.8.3`, `otpauth` `9.4.1` → `9.5.0`.
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `^1.26` → `^1.29`.

### Deferred majors

These majors were bumped by Dependabot but **reverted** before merging because their
migration cost crosses the platform's contract surface. They are not part of 0.5.0 and
are tracked as follow-up work:

| Package | Current pin | Dependabot proposed | Why deferred |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| `@mikro-orm/*` | `^6.6.10` | `^7.0.11` | v7 drops decorator re-exports and `persistAndFlush`/`removeAndFlush`, requires invasive migration across every `data/entities.ts` and all write paths |
| `typescript` | `^5.9.3` | `^6.0.3` | v6 deprecates `moduleResolution=node10` (`error TS5107`) across every package `tsconfig.json`; fix requires either `"ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"` everywhere or a real migration to `bundler`/`node16` |
| `awilix` | `^12.0.5` | `^13.0.3` | v13 changed the `Cradle` generic default from `any` to `{}`, which makes every `container.resolve('em')` return `unknown` at 100+ DI call sites with no code change |

When a dedicated spec and migration PR land for one of these, it will be listed in its own
`0.x.y → 0.x.(y+1)` window in this document and the corresponding `auto-upgrade-...` skill
will cover it.

### Breaking dependency changes that may affect user code

#### `<package>` `^<from>` → `^<to>`

<one paragraph describing the breakage>

```ts
// before
<...>

// after
<...>
```
```

When opening a PR that bumps a dependency across a major boundary, add an entry here in
the same PR. The `auto-upgrade-...` skill for the window picks up entries from this file;
keep the headings stable (exactly `#### \`<package>\` \`^<from>\` → \`^<to>\``) so the
skill can parse them.
